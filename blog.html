            <h3>Clever</h3>
            <p>Clever by Architectural Digest is an online magazine celebrating international design talents, championing industry innovation, and featuring home decor inspiration.

                This fabulous publication is somehow minimalist, chic and eccentric at the same time—with vibrant colors that hum of 80s retro pop art, and blocks that almost feel 3D. While the actual design itself is relatively stripped back, it’s jam-packed to the brim with character.

            <p><b>Amy says:</b>  The Mondrian style—colorful mosaic-like grids based on the designs of Dutch painter Piet Mondrian—is what initially grabs my attention on this website. Straight away, I can tell that this blog is going to be art and design focused.

                The designer uses a progressive rhythm to create a content hierarchy, adding a refreshing twist to the content card structure most commonly used by online publications. The interface is bright and makes good use of bold colors and patterns—a combination that can go catastrophically wrong if overdone.
                
                While the color palette is bold, the high contrast between the colors themselves paired with the bold geometric font choice tells me that the designer has reflected on the site’s accessibility. All the UI elements on this page work harmoniously together to promote unity. This level of attention to detail is no small feat!

            <h3>Girlboss</h3>
            <p>he Girlboss magazine is everything but understated. Set against the backdrop of just about every color under the sun, Girlboss brands itself as a magazine for working millennial women that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

                Girlboss doesn’t just play with different colors—they’ve also got a different font for pretty much every sentence, and have decided to keep readers on their toes with a mix of photography and illustration. Each section of the website feels like its own unique entity.
                
                With its eye-catching color palette, lack of font uniformity and overall mischievous tone, the Girlboss magazine has all the makings of a blog that will have you continually coming back for more.</p>

            <p><b>Amy says:</b> The most notable feature on the Girlboss website is the color palette: bold colors, combining pastels with deep, rich hues and oversaturated neons. Exciting as this color palette is, future designers should always consider users with varying grades of color blindness. The more variety you have in your color values (brightness, saturation, etc.), the harder it becomes to ensure adequate contrast.

                The desktop website has got a horizontal swipe, which is a design standard more commonly associated with mobile interfaces. While this initially takes some getting used to, the designer has provided two more traditional navigation options: an easily accessible navigation at the top of the page, and the typical hamburger menu in the top right.
                
                Once you’ve taken a minute to get your head around these quirks, the layout is relatively straightforward. The handy filter offering the reader the choice between viewing “new” or “popular” content is a nice touch and gives the reader a sense of agency. The cherry on top? They’re championing diversity throughout the imagery, which also reflects the brand well. It might seem obvious, but diversity representation is a common oversight when designing a blog—so well done to them!</p>

        <h3> Annual Digest</h3>
        <p>When it comes to blog design, simplicity often trumps complexity. This is undoubtedly the case with Annual Digest by Curate Mag. Aimed at entrepreneurs and young professionals, Annual Digest is an online magazine featuring a collection of thought pieces that both reflect on the past year and inspire for the year to come.

            Using large fonts and images is currently a super popular UI design—and Annual Digest has totally nailed it. It’s impossible not to be captivated by the use of color and drawn in by the digestible article titles.

        <p><b>Amy says:</b> Amy says: There is a lot of content presented on this page—but the designer’s clever use of variety keeps the reader interested. Combining subtle animations and transitions with bold imagery and a large typeface make for highly enjoyable navigation. What’s most striking about this site is the excellent execution of the typography; the clever combination of fonts is elegant and sophisticated, without being too serious.

            I’m equally impressed by the use of white space. Having vast stretches of white space lets the content breathe, and the images speak for themselves, facilitating a high-end and trustworthy tone. The juxtaposition of vibrant orange against a monochrome color palette is also incredibly visually stimulating. I could keep scrolling on this website all day! </p>

        <h3>Coda story</h3>
    <p>Coda story is an online political journal, covering topics ranging from humanitarian crises to disinformation stories. Coda story asserts that they are “format agnostic”—meaning they don’t adhere to the structural conventions of other blogs.

        With a list of documentaries, longreads, shortreads and animations, the Coda story publication is proof that political content doesn’t need to be dull to be taken seriously.</p>

        <p><b>Amy says:</b> I like how they’ve grouped the information related to each channel. As with some of the previous examples, the designer uses proximity to group content—but this time, the topics are cleverly color coded.

            The structure of each group is repeated, reducing the cognitive load created by the site’s complex navigation. Within each channel overview, the user has the opportunity to explore the channel more deeply. The option to ‘show more’ content without being redirected to another page also gives the user a sense of control.
            
            The great use of whitespace and the lack of distractions is conducive to the subject matter of the content: serious topics need clean interfaces. However, that’s not to say that the site is uninspiring! The subtle yet uplifting animations provide well-needed balance to the website’s tone.</p>
