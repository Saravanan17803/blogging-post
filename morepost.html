                <h3> Annual Digest</h3>
                <p>When it comes to blog design, simplicity often trumps complexity. This is undoubtedly the case with Annual Digest by Curate Mag. Aimed at entrepreneurs and young professionals, Annual Digest is an online magazine featuring a collection of thought pieces that both reflect on the past year and inspire for the year to come.

                    Using large fonts and images is currently a super popular UI design—and Annual Digest has totally nailed it. It’s impossible not to be captivated by the use of color and drawn in by the digestible article titles.

                <p><b>Amy says:</b> Amy says: There is a lot of content presented on this page—but the designer’s clever use of variety keeps the reader interested. Combining subtle animations and transitions with bold imagery and a large typeface make for highly enjoyable navigation. What’s most striking about this site is the excellent execution of the typography; the clever combination of fonts is elegant and sophisticated, without being too serious.

                    I’m equally impressed by the use of white space. Having vast stretches of white space lets the content breathe, and the images speak for themselves, facilitating a high-end and trustworthy tone. The juxtaposition of vibrant orange against a monochrome color palette is also incredibly visually stimulating. I could keep scrolling on this website all day! </p>

                <h3>Coda story</h3>
            <p>Coda story is an online political journal, covering topics ranging from humanitarian crises to disinformation stories. Coda story asserts that they are “format agnostic”—meaning they don’t adhere to the structural conventions of other blogs.

                With a list of documentaries, longreads, shortreads and animations, the Coda story publication is proof that political content doesn’t need to be dull to be taken seriously.</p>

                <p><b>Amy says:</b> I like how they’ve grouped the information related to each channel. As with some of the previous examples, the designer uses proximity to group content—but this time, the topics are cleverly color coded.

                    The structure of each group is repeated, reducing the cognitive load created by the site’s complex navigation. Within each channel overview, the user has the opportunity to explore the channel more deeply. The option to ‘show more’ content without being redirected to another page also gives the user a sense of control.
                    
                    The great use of whitespace and the lack of distractions is conducive to the subject matter of the content: serious topics need clean interfaces. However, that’s not to say that the site is uninspiring! The subtle yet uplifting animations provide well-needed balance to the website’s tone.</p>
