            <p>It’s no secret that blogs are the pillar of any successful company website. A frequently updated blog
                will drive traffic to the brand, guide users with targeted content, and act as a vital tool to engage
                with the broader community.</p>

                <h3>Clever</h3>
                <p>Clever by Architectural Digest is an online magazine celebrating international design talents,
                    championing industry innovation, and featuring home decor inspiration.

                    This fabulous publication is somehow minimalist, chic and eccentric at the same time—with vibrant
                    colors that hum of 80s retro pop art, and blocks that almost feel 3D. While the actual design itself
                    is relatively stripped back, it’s jam-packed to the brim with character.
                </p>

                <p><b>Amy says:</b> The Mondrian style—colorful mosaic-like grids based on the designs of Dutch painter
                    Piet Mondrian—is what initially grabs my attention on this website. Straight away, I can tell that
                    this blog is going to be art and design focused.

                    The designer uses a progressive rhythm to create a content hierarchy, adding a refreshing twist to
                    the content card structure most commonly used by online publications. The interface is bright and
                    makes good use of bold colors and patterns—a combination that can go catastrophically wrong if
                    overdone.

                    While the color palette is bold, the high contrast between the colors themselves paired with the
                    bold geometric font choice tells me that the designer has reflected on the site’s accessibility. All
                    the UI elements on this page work harmoniously together to promote unity. This level of attention to
                    detail is no small feat!

                <h3>Girlboss</h3>
                <p>he Girlboss magazine is everything but understated. Set against the backdrop of just about every
                    color under the sun, Girlboss brands itself as a magazine for working millennial women that doesn’t
                    take itself too seriously.

                    Girlboss doesn’t just play with different colors—they’ve also got a different font for pretty much
                    every sentence, and have decided to keep readers on their toes with a mix of photography and
                    illustration. Each section of the website feels like its own unique entity.

                    With its eye-catching color palette, lack of font uniformity and overall mischievous tone, the
                    Girlboss magazine has all the makings of a blog that will have you continually coming back for more.

                <p><b>Amy says:</b> The most notable feature on the Girlboss website is the color palette: bold colors,
                    combining pastels with deep, rich hues and oversaturated neons. Exciting as this color palette is,
                    future designers should always consider users with varying grades of color blindness. The more
                    variety you have in your color values (brightness, saturation, etc.), the harder it becomes to
                    ensure adequate contrast.

                    The desktop website has got a horizontal swipe, which is a design standard more commonly associated
                    with mobile interfaces. While this initially takes some getting used to, the designer has provided
                    two more traditional navigation options: an easily accessible navigation at the top of the page, and
                    the typical hamburger menu in the top right.

                    Once you’ve taken a minute to get your head around these quirks, the layout is relatively
                    straightforward. The handy filter offering the reader the choice between viewing “new” or “popular”
                    content is a nice touch and gives the reader a sense of agency. The cherry on top? They’re
                    championing diversity throughout the imagery, which also reflects the brand well. It might seem
                    obvious, but diversity representation is a common oversight when designing a blog—so well done to
                    them!</p>
